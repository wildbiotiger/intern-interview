# Interview Challenge!

Write an application (choose whichever language you're most comfortable with) that does the following:

1. Read in the list of names from `input.txt`
2. Read in the list of people to find from `compare.txt`
3. If a person in the compare list is found in the input list, print the name to the console

Please upload your code to GitHub (on your own repository) and be ready for a demonstration and review of your code for your interview.
